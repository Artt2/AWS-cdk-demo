# AWS-cdk-demo

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) allows users to define cloud infrastructure using a programming language chosen by the user (here it's TypeScript). Essentially an alternative to using CloudFormation straight from the AWS Management Console (CDK actually just creates CloudFormation templates).

Used cdk init to create a template and deployed a **CloudFormation** stack that defines a **SNS** topic and adds a subscription to that using **SQS**.
